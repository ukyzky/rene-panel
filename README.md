## Status

### v1.0

renepanel01a.zip

Production completed and works good.

There is an error in the position of some holes.

But the error in the position is a little, so assembly successful.

### v1.1

renepanel01a_v1.1.zip

Production not yet started.

Improved version of v1.0 the error in the position.

So it maybe works fine.

## Notes

The panel has the holes of LED for keyswitch.

The holes aren't connected to anywhere.

If you'd like to light up the keyswitches, please DIY external circuit, wiring etc.
